Path signals & Improved train pathfinder 0.9 [b]beta[/b]

This mod replaces block signaling system by path based signaling and provides improved path finding for trains

[h2]Path signals[/h2]
[b]Features[/b]
[list]
[*] Instead of allowing only one train in the signal block, each train reserves own path from one to the next signal.
[*] Signal is red by default, only when there is a path reserved for a train it will turn to green
[*] Ability to highlight reserved paths 
[/list]

[b]Planned features[/b]
[list]
[*] Differentiate semaphore and light signals by slightly different behaviour - 
        semaphore will clear reserved path after rear of the train passes last switch in the block and there will be a small delay before a new path can be reserved
        light signal will clear each path segment individually and there will be no delay
[*] Allow creating multi-aspect signals based on path reserved from signal 
[*] Real pre-signal which will have signalling based on the next signal (e.g. green-yellow-red sled navestidel) 
[/list]

[h2]Improved train pathfinder[/h2]
Pathfinder is based on Dijkstra algorithm for finding the best path.
[b]Features[/b]
[list]
[*] Try avoid go through stations, when there is a station bypass
[*] Prefer tracks with less curves
[*] Configurable highlighting train path
[/list]
[b]Planned features[/b]
[list]
[*] Calculating best path based on track speed restrictions, slopes, train length and acceleration
[*] Select best station platform based on potential colliding paths on arriving and departing
[*] Lot of optimization to improve performance 
[/list]
